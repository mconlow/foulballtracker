This is a project from the dawn of time that allows users to submit location data for foul balls at MLB stadiums.

It overlays them on top of the ballpark in a heat map.

It needs a mysql table. The credentials to access the db and table are in foulballtracker / ROOT / php_ajax_input_script.php. It also needs a clicks table, that schema is in the same file.
